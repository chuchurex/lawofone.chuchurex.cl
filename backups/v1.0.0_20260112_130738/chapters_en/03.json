          "text": "There is a question that haunts anyone who entertains these ideas: If we are truly eternal beings on a vast journey, why don't we remember? Why does each life begin in ignorance? Why do we have to figure everything out from scratch, stumbling through darkness when — if the story is true — we have already learned so much?"
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "The old traditions have an answer, and it is surprising. The forgetting, they say, is not a flaw in the design. It is the design. It is the very thing that makes this stage of the journey meaningful."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "Consider what it would be like to live without the forgetting. You would know with certainty that all beings are one. You would remember that this life is just one of countless lives. You would see clearly that suffering is temporary and that love is the ultimate reality. Nothing would be at stake. Nothing would be uncertain. Nothing would require faith."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "And that, according to this telling, is precisely the problem. In the earliest creations, the story goes, there was no forgetting. Beings moved through their experience with full awareness of who they were and where they came from. The result was a kind of spiritual stagnation. Without mystery, there was nothing to discover. Without darkness, light had no meaning. Without the possibility of genuine choice in genuine uncertainty, choices carried no weight."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "The forgetting was introduced as a gift — a strange gift, perhaps, but a gift nonetheless. By hiding the truth from conscious awareness, it creates the conditions for something precious: authentic choice, real faith, love that means something because it is offered without guarantee of return."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "Think of it this way. Anyone can love when they know they will be loved back. But to love in uncertainty, to give without knowing if you will receive, to trust when trust cannot be verified — this creates something that could not exist otherwise. It forges a kind of strength, a kind of beauty, that the traditions say is treasured throughout creation."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "The forgetting is not total. Beneath the surface of your conscious mind, the deeper part of you remembers everything. It knows who you are, why you came, what you are here to learn. But it cannot simply tell you. The knowledge has to be earned, discovered, gradually uncovered through the living of life."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "This is why intuition matters. This is why dreams sometimes carry messages that feel more true than waking life. This is why certain moments — a piece of music, a face in a crowd, a landscape that feels like home though you have never been there — can trigger a sense of recognition so deep it brings tears. These are the whispers of the part of you that knows."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "The forgetting also explains why silence and stillness are valued in every spiritual tradition. When the noise of daily life quiets down, the deeper knowing becomes audible. Meditation, prayer, contemplation — these are not ways of reaching something far away. They are ways of hearing what is already present, what has been speaking all along in a voice too quiet to hear over the din."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "And the forgetting is temporary. At the end of each life, the veil lifts. The full perspective returns. Everything becomes clear — who you were, why you came, what you learned, what you still need to learn. The confusion and uncertainty of incarnate life are revealed as the purposeful darkness of a sacred classroom."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "Perhaps this is why life can feel so intense, so urgent, so precious. On some level, even if we don't consciously remember, we know that this particular configuration of circumstances will never come again. This exact opportunity will not repeat. Whatever we are here to do, now is the time."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "You are not abandoned in the darkness. The part of you that knows is always present, always available. Help surrounds you — within and without, seen and unseen. The forgetting is real, but so is the remembering that waits on the other side of every moment of genuine seeking."
