          "text": "We come now to the question that hides beneath all other questions: What happens when we die? Every culture has its answers. Every person eventually faces the mystery. The traditions we are exploring offer their own account — not as certainty, but as one way of understanding what might await."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "According to this telling, death is not ending but transition. The consciousness that animated the body does not cease; it simply releases from one vehicle and assumes another. What you essentially are continues. Only the temporary clothing falls away."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "The traditions speak of a process that unfolds after the body's death. First, the consciousness gradually recognizes what has happened. Some understand immediately; others take time. Those who cling tightly to physical existence may linger for a while, confused, trying to interact with a world that can no longer feel them. But eventually, all move on."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "What follows is described as a kind of review. Not judgment by an external authority, but a thorough revisiting of the life just lived. Every significant moment can be experienced again — not only from your own perspective but from the perspective of all others involved. The pain you caused becomes fully visible. The love you gave reveals its true reach. Nothing is hidden. Everything is understood."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "This review is not punishment, though it may be humbling. It is an opportunity for complete honesty, for seeing clearly what was obscured during the living of life. The forgetting that made earthly existence possible lifts, and the full picture emerges. You evaluate your own progress. You see what you learned, what you missed, what you still need to learn."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "After the review comes healing. Where there was trauma, there is restoration. Where there were wounds — inflicted or received — there is gradual mending. The traditions speak of great patience in this process, of as much time as needed for the consciousness to integrate what it has experienced."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "And then, for those whose journey continues, there is planning. The soul participates in designing its next life — choosing the circumstances most likely to provide the lessons still needed, selecting challenges that will offer opportunities for growth, arranging to meet again with souls with whom there is unfinished work."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "What continues is not the personality as you know it. The particular configuration of preferences, habits, and memories that makes you recognizably you will be released. But something deeper persists — the essential self that has animated this personality and will animate others. The lessons learned, the growth achieved, the degree of love cultivated — these travel with you."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "If this account has any truth to it, then life looks different. The losses we fear are not what they seem. Those we love do not truly disappear. The relationships that matter continue in ways we cannot fully understand from this side of the veil."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "And the way we live matters. Every choice shapes what we are becoming. Every act of love, every moment of patience, every forgiveness extended — all of this accumulates into something that death does not erase. We are building something with our lives, something that survives."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "We cannot prove any of this. The mystery remains. But perhaps it offers comfort, or at least perspective. Death may not be the ending we fear. It may be more like waking from a dream — the discovery that we are vaster than we knew."
