# 📖 The Teachings of the Law of One

> A personal interpretation of Ra's material in Spanish

This is a personal project that presents the teachings of the Law of One in a more accessible and structured way, based on the original Ra material channeled by L/L Research.

**Website**: https://lawofone.chuchurex.cl

## ⚠️ Important Note

This project is a **personal interpretation** of the original Law of One material. It is not intended to replace the original material, which is available at:

- **Official site**: https://llresearch.org
- **Original material in Spanish**: https://www.lawofone.info/es

This book represents my own understanding and synthesis of the material and may contain personal distortions.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is a personal gift. I share it with the hope that it may serve other seekers, but I recognize that each person must find their own path to the Law of One material.
