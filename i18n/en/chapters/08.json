          "text": "We arrive at the question beneath all others: What happens when we die? Every culture offers answers. Every person eventually faces the mystery. The Law of One offers its own framework — not as certainty, but as one way of considering what might await."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "Death is not ending but transition. The consciousness that animated the body does not cease; it releases from one vehicle and eventually assumes another. What you essentially are continues. Only the temporary form dissolves."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "A process unfolds after physical death. First, consciousness gradually recognizes what has happened. Some understand immediately; others need time. Those who cling tightly to physical existence may remain confused for a period. But eventually, all move on."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "What follows is a kind of review — not judgment by external authority, but complete revisiting of the life just lived. Every significant moment can be experienced again, not only from your perspective but from that of everyone involved. The pain you caused becomes visible. The love you gave reveals its true reach. Nothing remains hidden."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "This review is not punishment, though it may be intense. It is an opportunity for complete honesty, for seeing clearly what the forgetting obscured. You evaluate your own progress. You see what you learned, what you missed, what you still need to learn."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "After comes healing. Where there was trauma, there is restoration. Where there were wounds, there is gradual repair. There is great patience in this process — as much time as needed to integrate what was experienced."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "For those whose journey continues, there is planning. The soul participates in designing its next life — choosing circumstances that will provide needed lessons, selecting challenges that will offer specific opportunities, arranging to meet souls with whom there is pending work."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "What continues is not the personality as you know it. The particular configuration of preferences, habits, and memories that makes you recognizable will be released. But something deeper persists — the essential self that has animated this and other personalities. The lessons learned, the growth achieved, the capacity for love cultivated — these travel with you."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "If this framework has validity, then life looks different. The losses we fear are not what they seem. Those we love do not truly disappear. The relationships that matter continue in ways we do not fully understand from this side."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "And how we live matters. Every choice shapes what we are becoming. Every act of love, every moment of patience, every forgiveness extended — all accumulates into something that death does not erase. We are building something with our lives."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "We cannot prove any of this. The mystery remains. But perhaps it offers perspective. Death may not be the ending we fear. It may be more like waking — the discovery that we are vaster than we knew."
