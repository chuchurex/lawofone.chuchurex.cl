          "text": "If we are truly eternal consciousnesses on a vast journey, an obvious question arises: why don't we remember? Why does each life begin in ignorance? The Law of One offers a surprising answer: the forgetting is not an error. It is an essential part of the design."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "Think of it this way: if you remembered with certainty that we are all one, that this life is one among many, that suffering is temporary and love the ultimate reality — what would really be at stake? What would it mean to choose love when you know with certainty it is the only correct answer?"
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "In earlier stages of creation, the forgetting did not exist. Consciousnesses moved with full knowledge of who they were and where they came from. The result was a kind of stagnation. Without mystery, there was nothing to discover. Without uncertainty, choices had no real weight."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "The forgetting was introduced as a gift — strange, perhaps, but a gift nonetheless. By hiding truth from waking consciousness, it creates the conditions for something precious: authentic choice, real faith, love that means something because it is offered without guarantee of return."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "Anyone can love when they know they will be loved back. But to love in uncertainty, to give without knowing if you will receive, to trust when you cannot verify — this creates something that could not exist otherwise."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "The forgetting is not total. Beneath the surface of the conscious mind, something deeper remembers. This is why intuition matters. This is why dreams sometimes carry messages that feel more true than waking life. This is why certain moments — a piece of music, a landscape, an encounter — can trigger inexplicable recognition."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "The forgetting also explains why silence and stillness appear in every spiritual tradition. When the noise of daily life quiets, something deeper can become audible. Meditation, prayer, contemplation — these are ways of hearing what the bustle normally drowns out."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "And the forgetting is temporary. At the end of each life, the full perspective returns. Everything becomes clear — who you were, why you came, what you learned. The confusion of incarnate life is revealed as the intentional darkness of a classroom."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "Perhaps this is why life can feel so intense, so urgent. On some level, even if we don't consciously remember, we know that this particular configuration will not repeat. Whatever we are here to do, now is the time."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "You are not abandoned in the darkness. The part of you that knows is always available, waiting to be consulted. The forgetting is real, but so is the remembering that waits on the other side of every moment of genuine seeking."
